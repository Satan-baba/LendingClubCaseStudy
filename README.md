# Lending Club Case Study
To aid in the decision making process for Loan approval/decline using data to indetify top drivers for loan default.  



## General Information
Lending club is currently facing challenges with their loan approval/declines process. This case study involves performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns in consumer attributes and loan characteristics that might be strong indicators of loan default. Based on the loan default patterns, we can take business decisions minimizing the risk associated with the loan.
There are majorly two types of risks that can be minimized:
When the customer will not default on the loan but the loan is not approved - risk losing revenue
When the customer will default on the loan but the loan is approved - risk of losing capital

Loan default is the largest financial loss to a financial lending company. Our objective is to analyze customer and loan attributes and identify patterns that indicate a strong possibility of default.
In other words, the company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.  The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment. 
In the loan.csv file, each row corresponds to the different loan and customer attributes during a loan application. On initial look, customer attributes such as annual income and loan attributes such as interest rate, term seem to inituitively govern if the customer will default on the loan.
